Captcha::AreYouAHuman
=====================

Integrate the AreYouAHuman.com CAPTCHA-alternative human verification 
into your Perl application

AreYouAHuman.com provides a novel game-play approach to human verification; 
instead of deciphering some text, you do a simple task in a fun game.  
You can sign up for a free publisher key at AreYouAHuman.com to start 
using it right away.  

Contact us or check out our website if you are interested in a bespoke
design or other customization.

Note: The Perl 5 Packaging is based on Captcha::Peoplesign; thank you for a
great example to follow. If you can't use our module, you should check that
one out.
